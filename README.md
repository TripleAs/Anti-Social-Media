# *Anti-social Media*

**Anti-Social Media** is a social media platform designed for introverted people who prefer a more personal and intimate space to share with close friends. Anti-Social Media strives to be different from other social media platforms because it centers on allowing users to be themselves and to provide each other with emotional support. It focuses on the quality of connections rather than the quantity.
